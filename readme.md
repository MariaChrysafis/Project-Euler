# Project Euler

Solving Project Euler problems with different languages!

So far, I've used Julia, C++, Python, Nim, Kotlin, D, Haskell and Pari-GP to solve at least one problem.

| Problem | C++ | Python | Nim | Julia | D | PARI/GP | Haskell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h |
