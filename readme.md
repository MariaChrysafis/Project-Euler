# Project Euler

Solving Project Euler problems with different languages!

So far, I've used Julia, C++, Python, Nim, Kotlin, D, Haskell and Pari-GP to solve at least one problem.

| Problem | C++ | Python | Nim | Julia | D | PARI/GP | Haskell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Problem #1: Multiples of 3 or 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) |  |  |  | [Code](https://github.com/MariaChrysafis/Project-Euler/blob/main/1.hs) |  |  |  |
